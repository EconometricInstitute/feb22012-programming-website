that can be carried out with them.</p><p>Think for instance of a String: it is a set of all words or letter combinations you can think of, and you can use its operations, such as requesting the length of the String.</p></Solution><h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3><p>What is an object?</p><Solution><p>An object is an instance of a class, so from one class, several objects can be made. An object has instance variables that are specific to the internal state of that object. The object's methods specify what the object does.</p><p>Think for instance of dogs. A class can be called <code class=\"language-text\">Dog</code>. Each dog has its own characteristics (i.e. states) and behaviors. The states of a dog could be his color, name, and breed. Its behaviors could be wagging the tail, barking, or eating.</p></Solution><p>What is a constructor?</p><Solution><p>A constructor instantiates a new object when you use the <code class=\"language-text\">new</code> keyword.\nThe object's variables are set to default or to arguments that you passed to the constructor.</p></Solution><p>What does a class do?</p><Solution><p>A class contains the blueprint needed to create objects, and also defines the objects' variables and methods. An object is created on the basis of the class constructor.</p></Solution></Exercise></div>","frontmatter":{"path":"/week1/1-why-java","title":"Why
