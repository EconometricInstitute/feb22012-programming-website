In Introduction to Programming, you are expected to have installed IntelliJ. If you have done so, you can skip this page and its description. However, if you bought a new laptop or lost the program somehow, you can follow the installation guide here.

In this page, we will guide you through the installation of IntelliJ on your personal computer.
IntelliJ will be the default programming environment, the program in which you will write the code, that we use for this course.
It comes pre-installed on university computers, so if you plan to only work from those you can skip the remainder of this page.

## Installation Video
The following video shows how the installation looks like on Windows and guides you through the installation procedure.

## Installation Steps
The steps described in the video are the following:
1. [Download the educational version of IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/edu-products/download/#section=idea).
2. Make sure the right operating system is selected (.exe for Windows, .dmg for MacOS, .tar.gz for Linux)
3. Click on *Download*. You may be asked in your browser to select a location to save it. It will then start downloading the free educational version of IntelliJ.
4. When the downloading is done, open the *.exe-file* (or .dmg in case of Mac OS) by clicking on it.
5. Your computer will ask for permission to change files. Please click *yes*. Then click *next*.
6. Select an installation directory for the program and click *next*.
7. Select 64-bit of 32-bit launcher, depending on your Operating System. 64-bits is most common.
8. Also select all four file associations. Then click *next* again.
9. Click *install*. This might take a while. If it's done, click *finish*.
10. You are ready and set. Good luck with this programming course!

Note that installing the program might be a bit different on Linux. See the `Installation Instructions` on the download page for further information.

## Installing java
Lastly, it is needed to install a recent version of the Java Development Kit, if you haven't already one installed on your PC. You can download a recent version of the Java JDK [via this link](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases). On this page, select the `OpenJDK 11 (LTS)` version and make sure the `Hotspot` JVM is selected. Then find your operating system in the list. In particular, make sure to choose either the 64-bit or 32-bit version depending on your operating system. Moreover, on Windows, select the `.msi` download. If you are working on Mac, use the `.pkg` download instead. After downloading, open the downloaded file and follow the installation steps that are shown on the screen to complete the installation.
