In your own small projects you may end up with a few classes which use inheritance, but often not more than a few. However, many useful libraries, which you are likely to end up using, make extensive use of it. Often these libraries have a lot of classes, which can be daunting to the uninitiated, but with a diagram it is often easy to understand the structure of these libraries. For example when you create Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). 

In these diagrams, we follow the following conventions:


We will now consider one class hierarchies from the standard library: the Exception class hierarchy.
