## Randomness
Encryption algorithms, machine learning and making computer games less predictable all require randomness. It is hard to realize randomness on a computer, since a computer can't make decisions on its own: a computer works deterministically. But, we can model randomness using pseudo random numbers. 
In Java, the most-used Pseudo Random Number (PRN) generator is a linear congruential generator, following the recursive relation of

X<sub>n+1</sub> = (a X<sub>n</sub> + c) mod m

Where Java uses the constants multiplier a = 11, increment c = 25214903917 and modulus m = 2<sup>48</sup>. The starting number X<sub>0</sub> of a sequence is called a **seed**. The choices of a, c and m are made with the idea to have very long periods so that it is very unlikely for the same sequence to occur twice, unless you pick the same seed. You can choose the seed yourself, which will of course always generate the same sequence of numbers. If you do not choose a seed, it will be pseudo random too and a different sequence of numbers will be used every time you run your program.

This PRN works well enough for this course, but suffers from serial correlation so that it is not the best PRN one could imagine. You will learn more on pseudo random numbers in the Simulation course (FEB22013(X)).

## Random class
Java offers the ready-made `Random` class for creating random numbers, which follows the linear congruential formula mentioned above. An instance of the Random class can be used as follows:

```java
import java.util.Random;

public class Raffle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random ladyLuck = new Random(); // create Random object ladyLuck

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            // Draw and print a random number
            int randomNumber = ladyLuck.nextInt(10);
            System.out.println(randomNumber);
        }
    }
}
```

Above we create an instance of the `Random` class. It has `nextInt` method, which gets an integer as a parameter. The method returns a random number from the range `[0, integer)`. Please notice that the upper bound is not included.

The program output is not always the same, unless we would have created the Random ladyLuck using a seed, by `Random ladyLyck = new Random(233)` with 233 being the seed here. Obviously, we did not set a seed here, so one possible output is the following:

<sample-output>

2
2
4
3
4
5
6
0
7
8

</sample-output>


<programming-exercise name='Numbers' tmcname='part12-Part12_06.Numbers'>

Write a program that prompts the user for how many random numbers should be generated and then prints the numbers. The printed numbers should be within the range `[0, 10]`. Below are some examples.

<sample-output>

How many random numbers should be printed?
**4**
9
1
4
3

</sample-output>

<sample-output>

How many random numbers should be printed?
**8**
9
6
0
9
10
7
3
3

</sample-output>

</programming-exercise>

We can use the `nextInt` method to create diverse randomness.
For example, we might need a program to give us a temperature between [-30,50].
We can do this by first creating a random number between 0 and 80 and then subtracting 30 from it.

```java
Random weatherMan = new Random();
int temperature = weatherMan(81) - 30;
System.out.println(temperature);
```

<programming-exercise name='Die' tmcname='part12-Part12_07.Die'>

The exercise template contains a class `Die`, which has the following body:

```java
import java.util.Random;

public class Die {
    private Random random;
    private int numberOfFaces;

    public Die(int numberOfFaces) {
        this.random = new Random();
        // Initialize the value of numberOfFaces here
    }

    public int throwDie() {
        // generate a random number which may be any number
        // between one and the number of faces, and then return it
    }
}
```

Modify the class, such that the constructor `Die(int numberOfFaces)` creates a new die-object with the given number of faces (i.e., the number of "sides" with a number). Also, modify the method `throwDie` so it returns the result of a random throw of the die, which should be a value withing the range `1 ... number of faces`.

The following is a main program for testing the die:

```java
public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Die die = new Die(6);

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(die.throwDie());
        }
    }
}
```

The output could be as follows:

<sample-output>

1
6
3
5
3
3
2
2
6
1

</sample-output>

</programming-exercise>

## Random probabilities
A Random object can also be used to create random doubles. These can for example be used for calculating probabilities. Computers often simulate probabilities using doubles between [0,1].

The `nextDouble` method of the Random class creates random doubles.
Let's assume the weather follows these probabilities:

- There is 0.1 probability it rains (10%)
- There is 0.3 probability it snows (30%)
- There is 0.6 probability the sun shines (60%)

Let's create a weather forecast using these probabilities.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Random;

public class WeatherMan {
    private Random random;

    public WeatherMan() {
        this.random = new Random();
    }

    public String forecast() {
        double probability = this.random.nextDouble();

        if (probability <= 0.1) {
            return "It rains";
        } else if (probability <= 0.4) { // 0.1 + 0.3
            return "It snows";
        } else { // rest, 1.0 - 0.4 = 0.6
            return "The sun shines";
        }
    }

    public int makeAForecast() {
        return (int) (4 * this.random.nextGaussian() - 3);
    }
}
```

The `makeAForecast` method is interesting in many ways. The `this.random.nextGaussian()` call is a regular method call. However what is interesting is that this method of the `Random` class returns a normally distributed number. If you are curious about other random methods in Java, take a look at the methods of the [Random class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html), using Java Documentation!
In this method we use explicit type casting to convert doubles to integers `(int)`. We can equally convert integers to doubles with `(double) integer`.

Let's now add a main which uses the `WeatherMan` class.

```java
// imports

public class Program {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WeatherMan forecaster = new WeatherMan();

        // save days of the week to a list
        ArrayList<String> days = new ArrayList<>();
        days.add("Mon");
        days.add("Tue");
        days.add("Wed");
        days.add("Thu");
        days.add("Fri");
        days.add("Sat");
        days.add("Sun");

        System.out.println("Next week's weather forecast:");

        for (String day : days) {
            String weatherForecast = forecaster.forecast();
            int temperatureForecast = forecaster.makeAForecast();

            System.out.println(day + ": " + weatherForecast + " " + temperatureForecast + " degrees.");
        }
    }
}
```

The program output could be:

<sample-output>

Next week's weather forecast:
Mon: It snows 1 degrees.
Tue: It snows 1 degrees.
Wed: The sun shines -2 degrees.
Thu: The sun shines 0 degrees.
Fri: It snows -3 degrees.
Sat: It snows -3 degrees.
Sun: The sun shines -5 degrees

</sample-output>

<programming-exercise name='Lottery' tmcname='part12-Part12_08.Lottery'>

Your assignment is to complete the class `LotteryRow`, which is used to draw the week's winning numbers. The numbers are in range 1--40, and 7 numbers will be drawn in total. In other words, a lottery row consists of seven different numbers that are all in range 1--40.

We wish to implement the following functions in the class:

- the constructor `LotteryRow` creates a new LotteryRow object that contains new randomized numbers.

- the method `numbers` returns the drawn lottery numbers of this lottery row

- the method `containsNumber` tells whether the given number is included in the drawn numbers

- the method `randomizeNumbers` randomizes new numbers for the lottery row.

The basic structure of the class is as follows:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Random;

    public class LotteryRow {
    private ArrayList<Integer> numbers;

    public LotteryRow() {
        this.randomizeNumbers();
    }

    public ArrayList<Integer> numbers() {
        return this.numbers;
    }

    public boolean containsNumber(int number) {
        // Tests whether the number is already among the randomized numbers
        return false;
    }

    public void randomizeNumbers() {
        // initialize the list for numbers
        this.numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        // Implement the randomization of the numbers by using the method containsNumber() here
    }

    public boolean equals(Object other) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

The following main program is supplied in the exercise base:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LotteryRow row = new LotteryRow();
        ArrayList<Integer> lotteryNumbers = row.numbers();

        System.out.println("Lottery numbers:");
        for (int number: lotteryNumbers) {
            System.out.print(number + " ");
        }

        System.out.println("");
    }
}
```

Here are a few possible outputs of the program:

<sample-output>

Lottery numbers:
3 5 10 14 15 27 37

</sample-output>


<sample-output>

Lottery numbers:
2 9 11 18 23 32 34

</sample-output>

**NB!** The same number can only appear once in a lottery row. The numbers don't need to be ordered.

<text-box variant='hint' name='On randomness of numbers'>

We can predict how computers work, because they slavishly execute any command we give them. Is a random number generated by a computer then really random?

Random numbers used by computer programs are typically pseudo random. They seem like random numbers, but in reality they follow some algorithmically created series of numbers.
Most of the time, pseudo random is good enough -- for example, the user will not notice any difference when YouTube random play is pseudo random.
On the other hand, if random numbers are used for scientific calculations, using a weak pseudo random number generator can lead to questionable results.
One example is IBM's  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RANDU" target="_blank" norel>RANDU</a> which was used for a short while in the 1960s.
<br/>

All randomness in computer programs is not pseudo random. Programs aiming for stronger randomness use, among other things, real life random phenomena to generate random numbers.
For example space radiation or <a href="https://www.wired.com/2003/08/random/" target="_blank" norel>lava lamps</a> are thought to be random phenomena.
