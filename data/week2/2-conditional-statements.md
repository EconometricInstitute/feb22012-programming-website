</text-box>

So far, our programs have executed from top to bottom without major surprises or conditional behavior. However, we usually want to add conditional logic to our programs. By this we mean functionality that's in one way or another dependent on the state of the program's variables.

To branch the execution of a program based on user input, for example, we need to use something known as a **conditional statement**. The simplest conditional statement looks something like this.

```java
System.out.println("Hello, world!");
if (true) {
    System.out.println("This code is unavoidable!");
}
```

<sample-output>

Hello, world!
This code is unavoidable!

</sample-output>

A conditional statement begins with the keyword `if` followed by parentheses. An expression is placed inside the parentheses, which is evaluated when the conditional statement is reached. The result of the evaluation is a boolean value. No evaluation occurred above. Instead, a boolean value was explicitly used in the conditional statement.

The parentheses are followed by a block, which is defined inside opening `{` and closing `}` curly brackets. The source code inside the block is executed if the expression inside the parentheses evaluates to _true_. On the other hand, if the expression evaluates to false, the execution moves on to the statement after the closing curly bracket of the current conditional statement.

Be aware of the fact that an `if` -statement is not followed by a semicolon since the statement doesn't end after the conditional. Let's now look at an example where we compare numbers in the conditional statement.

```java
int number = 11;
if (number < 10) {
    System.out.println("The number was less than 10");
}
```
Note that the sentence "The number was less than 10" will not be printed, since the condition `number < 10 ` does not hold for the variable `number` with value `11`.

## Code Indentation and Block Statements
A code block refers to a section enclosed by a pair of curly brackets. The source file containing the program includes the string `public class`, which is followed by the name of the program and the opening curly bracket of the block. The block ends in a closing curly bracket. The recurring snippet `public static void main(String[] args)` in the programs begins a block, and the source code within it is executed when the program is run. This snippet is, in fact, the starting point of all programs. Blocks define a program's structure and its bounds. A curly bracket must always have a matching pair: any code that's missing a closing (or opening) curly bracket is erroneous.

A conditional statement also marks the start of a new code block. In addition to the defining program structure and functionality, block statements also have an effect on the readability of a program. Code living inside a block is indented. For example, any source code inside the block of a conditional statement is indented four spaces deeper than the `if` command that started the conditional statement. Four spaces can also be added by pressing the `tab` key. When the block ends, i.e., when we encounter a `}` character, the indentation also ends. The `}` character is at the same level of indentation as the `if`-command that started the conditional statement.

The example below is correctly indented.

```java
if (number > 10) {
    number = 9;
}
```

Code in Java is indented either by four spaces or a single tab for each block. Use either spaces or tabs for indentation, not both. For automatic indendation in IntelliJ, you can use the shortcut `Ctrl + alt + L`. From now on your program code needs to be indented correctly in the exercises as well. If the indentation is incorrect, style points may be deducted for the graded assignments.

## Relational Operators
As you might have noticed, in the argument of conditional statements, some comparison operators, also referred to as `relational operators` are used to compare numbers. In Java, we use the following relational operators:

- `>` greater than
- `>=` greater than or equal to
- `<` less than
- `<=` less than or equal to
- `==` equal to
- `!=` not equal to

An example of two relational operators being used in code is given below:
```java
int number = 55;

if (number != 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is not equal to 0");
}

if (number >= 1000) {
    System.out.println("The number is at least 1000");
}
```

<programming-exercise name="Orwell">

Write a program that prompts the user for an integer and prints the string "Orwell" if the number is exactly 1984.

<sample-output>

Give a number:
**1983**

</sample-output>

<sample-output>

Give a number:
**1984**
Orwell

</sample-output>

</programming-exercise>

## Else
If the expression inside the parentheses of the conditional statement evaluates to false, then the execution of the code moves to the statement following the closing curly bracket of the current conditional statement. This is not always desired, and usually we want to create an alternative option for when the conditional expression evaluates to false. This can be done with the help of the `else` command, which is used together with the `if` command.

```java
int number = 4;

if (number > 5) {
    System.out.println("Your number is greater than five!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Your number is five or less!");
}
```

If an `else` branch has been specified for a conditional statement, the block defined by the else branch is run in the case that the condition of the conditional statement is false. The `else`-command is placed on the same line as the closing bracket of the block defined by the `if`-command. In the following example, the argument for the if-statement is false, so that the program
will return the code block under the `else` command. The output will be: "Your number is five or less."

<programming-exercise name="Adulthood">

Write a program that prompts the user for their age and tells them whether they are an adult (18 years old or older).

<sample-output>

How old are you?
**12**
You are not an adult

</sample-output>

<sample-output>

How old are you?
**32**
You are an adult

</sample-output>

</programming-exercise>

## More Conditionals: else if
In the case of multiple conditionals, we use the `else if`-command. The command `else if` is like `else`, but with an additional condition. `else if` follows the `if`-condition, and there may be multiple of them.

```java
int number = 3;

if (number == 1) {
    System.out.println("The number is one");
} else if (number == 2) {
    System.out.println("The given number is two");
} else if (number == 3) {
    System.out.println("The number must be three!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Something else!");
}
```

Let's read out the example above: 'If the number is one, then print "The number is one", else if the number is two, then print "The given number is two", else if the number is three, then print "The number must be three!". Otherwise, print "Something else!"'

The step-by-step visualization of the code above is as follows:

In the following video, we show what it looks like when we write a program using if, else and if-else systems in IntelliJ.

<panopto src="https://eur.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=72ad852b-4f50-4e72-bdac-ace200f7437c&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&start=0&interactivity=all"></panopto>


## Conditional Statement Expression and the Boolean Variable
The value that goes between the parentheses of the conditional statement should be of type boolean after the evaluation. `boolean` type variables are either _true_ or _false_. A conditional statement can also be done as follows:

```java
boolean isItTrue = true;
if (isItTrue) {
    System.out.println("Pretty wild!");
}
```

Comparison operators can also be used outside of conditionals. In those cases, the boolean value resulting from the comparison is stored in a boolean variable for later use.

```java
int first = 1;
int second = 3;
boolean isGreater = first > second;
```

In the example above, the boolean variable `isGreater` now contains the boolean value _false_. We can extend the previous example by adding a conditional statement to it.

```java
int first = 1;
int second = 3;
boolean isLessThan = first < second;

if (isLessThan) {
    System.out.println("1 is less than 3!");
}
```
The program finally prints: 1 is less than 3!

<!-- ### Modulo operator
The modulo operator is a slightly less-used operator, which is, however, very handy when we want to check the divisibility of a number, for example. The symbol for the modulo operator is `%`. The output of a modulo operator is the remainder after division of the first number by the second number.

```java
int remainder = 7 % 2;
System.out.println(remainder); // prints 1
System.out.println(5 % 3); // prints 2
System.out.println(7 % 4); // prints 3
System.out.println(8 % 4); // prints 0
System.out.println(1 % 2); // prints 1
```

If we want to know whether the number given by the user is divisible by four hundred, we check if the remainder is zero after taking the modulo of the number and four hundred. Since the modulo is an operation just like other calculations, it can be a part of an expression in a conditional statement.

```java
Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

int number = Integer.valueOf(reader.nextLine());

if (number % 400 == 0) {
    System.out.println("The number " + number + " is divisible by four hundred.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The number " + number + " is not divisible by four hundred.");
}
``` -->

## Conditional Statements and Comparing Strings
Even though we can compare integers, floating point numbers, and boolean values using two equals signs (`variable1 == variable2`), we cannot compare the equality of strings using two equals signs.

You can try this with the following program:

```java
Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

System.out.println("Enter the first string");
String first = reader.nextLine();
System.out.println("Enter the second string");
String second = reader.nextLine();

if (first == second) {
    System.out.println("The strings were the same!");
} else {
    System.out.println("The strings were different!");
}
```

<sample-output>

Enter the first string
**same**
Enter the second string
**same**
The strings were different!

</sample-output>

<sample-output>

Enter the first string
**same**
Enter the second string
**different**
The strings were different!

</sample-output>

This has to do with the internal workings of strings as well as how variable comparison is implemented in Java. In practice, the comparison is affected by how much information a variable can hold -- strings can hold a limitless amount of characters, whereas integers, floating-point numbers, and boolean values always contain a single number or value only. Variables that always contain only one number or value can be compared using an equals sign, whereas this doesn't work for variables containing more information. We will return to this topic later in this course.

When comparing strings we use the `equals`-command, which is related to string variables. The `equals` command is written after a string by attaching it to the string to be compared with a dot. The command is given a parameter, which is the string that the variable will be compared against. If the string variable is being directly compared with a string, then the string can be placed inside the parentheses of the equals-command within quotation marks. Otherwise, the name of the string variable that holds the string to be compared is placed inside the parentheses. The command works in the following way:

```java
Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

System.out.println("Enter a string");
String input = reader.nextLine();

if (input.equals("a string")) {
    System.out.println("Great! You read the instructions correctly.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Missed the mark!");
}
```

In the example below the user is prompted for two strings. We first check to see if the provided strings are the same, after which we'll check if the value of either one of the two strings is "two strings".

```java
Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

System.out.println("Input two strings");
String first = reader.nextLine();
String second = reader.nextLine();

if (first.equals(second)) {
    System.out.println("The strings were the same!");
} else {
    System.out.println("The strings were different!");
}

if (first.equals("two strings")) {
    System.out.println("Clever!");
}

if (second.equals("two strings")) {
    System.out.println("Sneaky!");
}
```
<programming-exercise name="Same">

Write a program that prompts the user for two strings. If the strings are the same, then the program prints "Same". Otherwise, it prints "Different".

<sample-output>

Enter the first string:
**hello**
Enter the second string:
**hello**
Same

</sample-output>

<sample-output>

Enter the first string:
**hello**
Enter the second string:
**world**
Different

</sample-output>

</programming-exercise>

## Logical Operators
The expression of a conditional statement may consist of multiple parts, in which the logical operators **and** `&&`, **or** `||`, and **not** `!` are used.

- An expression consisting of two expressions combined using the and-operator is true, if and only if both of the combined expressions evaluate to true.

- An expression consisting of two expressions combined using the or-operator is true if either one, or both, of the combined expressions evaluate to true.

- Logical operators are not used for changing the boolean value from true to false, or false to true.

In the next example we combine two individual conditions using `&&` (the and-operator). The code is used to check if the number in the variable is greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 10. In other words, we whether 7 is within the range of 5-10, which should give the output "It is!":

```java
System.out.println("Is the number within the range 5-10? ");
int number = 7;

if (number >= 5 && number <= 10) {
    System.out.println("It is! :)");
} else {
    System.out.println("It is not :(")
}
```

In the next one we provide two conditions using `||` (the or-operator): is the number less than zero or greater than 100? The condition is fulfilled if the number fulfills either one of the two conditions, which is true for 145:

```java
System.out.println("Is the number less than 0 or greater than 100");
int number = 145;

if (number < 0 || number > 100) {
    System.out.println("It is! :)");
} else {
    System.out.println("It is not :(");
}
```

In the next example we flip the result of the expression `number > 4` using `!`, i.e., the not-operator. The not-operator is written in such a way that the expression to be flipped is wrapped in parentheses, and the not-operator is placed before the parentheses.

```java
int number = 7;

if (!(number > 4)) {
    System.out.println("The number is not greater than 4.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The number is greater than 4.");
}
```

</programming-exercise>

## Execution order
#### Order of Execution for Comparisons
The comparisons are executed top down. When execution reaches a conditional statement whose condition is true, its block is executed and the comparison stops.

```java
int number = 5;

if (number == 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is zero.");
} else if (number > 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is greater than zero.");
} else if (number > 2) {
    System.out.println("The number is greater than two.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The number is less than zero.");
}
```

The example above prints the string "The number is greater than zero." even if the condition `number > 2` is true. The comparison stops at the first condition that evaluates
to true.

#### Execution Order of Conditional Statements
Let's familiarize ourselves with the execution order of conditional statements through a classic programming exercise.

_'Write a program that prompts the user for a number between one and one hundred, and prints that number. If the number is divisible by three, then print "Fizz" instead of the number. If the number is divisible by five, then print "Buzz" instead of the number. If the number is divisible by both three and five, then print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.'_

The programmer begins solving the exercise by reading the exercise description and by writing code according to the description. The conditions for execution are presented in a given order by the description, and the initial structure for the program is formed based on that order. The structure is formed based on the following steps:

- Write a program that prompts the user for a number and prints that number.

- If the number is divisible by three, then print "Fizz" instead of the number.

- If the number is divisible by five, then print "Buzz" instead of the number.

- If the number is divisible by both three and five, then print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

If-type conditions are easy to implement using `if - else if - else` -conditional statements. The code below was written based on the steps above, but it does not work correctly, which we can see from the example.

```java
Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

int number = 15;

if (number % 3 == 0) {
    System.out.println("Fizz");
} else if (number % 5 == 0) {
    System.out.println("Buzz");
} else if (number % 3 == 0 && number % 5 == 0) {
    System.out.println("FizzBuzz");
} else {
    System.out.println(number);
}
```

The problem with the previous approach is that **the parsing of conditional statements stops at the first condition that is true**. E.g., with the value 15 the string "Fizz" is printed, since the number is divisible by three (15 % 3 == 0).

One approach for developing this train of thought would be to first find the **most demanding condition**, and implement it. After that, we would implement the other conditions. In the example above, the condition "if the number is divisible by both three **and** five" requires two things to happen. Now the train of thought would be:

1. Write a program that reads input from the user.

2. If the number is divisible by both three and five, then print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

3. If the number is divisible by three, then print "Fizz" instead of the number.

4. If the number is divisible by five, then print "Buzz" instead of the number.

5. Otherwise, the program prints the number given by the user.

This corresponds to the following code:

```java
Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

int number = Integer.valueOf(reader.nextLine());

if (number % 3 == 0 && number % 5 == 0) {
    System.out.println("FizzBuzz");
} else if (number % 3 == 0) {
    System.out.println("Fizz");
} else if (number % 5 == 0) {
    System.out.println("Buzz");
} else {
    System.out.println(number);
}
```
