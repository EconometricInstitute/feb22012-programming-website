The final grade for the course is composed of the grades obtained for assignments (60%) and for the grade of the exam (40%). Note that the exam can be retaken at the end of the academic year (under the conditions set by the university), but that the assignments can only be retaken in the next academic year.

## Assignments  
Three graded assignments sets will be published via Canvas, which have a deadline in week 2, 4 and 6 of the course, respectively. Each assignment counts for 20% in the final grade. Note that these assignments are different ones than the practice assignments that can be found on this website, where the assignments on this site are there strictly for practicing. The graded assignments have to be completed individually and feedback can be obtained on them, also before the deadline, by means of an online grading system.

Assignments are graded based on two criteria:
- Correctness: Does your program work according to the specification?
- Coding Quality and Style: Is your code well written and understandable?
We provide a detailed code quality and style guide [here](https://erasmusuniversityautolab.github.io/FEB22012-StyleGuide/), but the final verdict of coding quality and style comes from human graders.

Assignments are handed in via CodeGrade, which can be accessed by clicking on the assignment in Canvas. 
You need to hand in assignments **individually**, and you need to write the code you hand in **by yourself**. This means that you cannot copy code from the internet (including Stack Exchange). You need to explain how your code works, by use of comments.

### Plagiarism
We use **plagiarism scanning tools**. If we find any cases of suspected plagiarism, we are required to report these cases to the exam committee.
The analysis of suspected plagiarism can take a couple of months, due to other teaching obligations.
Since last year, students who were caught **failed the course** and got FR on their grade list.

## Exam
As it seems now, the exam will take place *on campus*, on Tuesday October 19th at 9:30 ðŸ•¤. The exam takes 3 hours on paper, and is theoretically focussed. The exam will be a closed book exam. Further details on how the exam will look like will follow in due time via Canvas.
