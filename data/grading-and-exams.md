The final grade for the course is composed of the grades obtained for assignments (60%) and for the grade of the exam (40%). Note that the exam can be retaken at the end of the academic year (under the conditions set by the university), but that the assignments can only be retaken in the next academic year.

## Assignments
Three graded assignments sets will be published via Canvas, which have a deadline in week 3, 5 and 7 of the course, respectively. Each assignment counts for 20% in the final grade. Note that these assignments are different ones than the practice assignments that can be found on this website, where the assignments on this site are there strictly for practicing. The graded assignments have to be completed individually and feedback can be obtained on them, also before the deadline, by means of an online grading system.

Assignments are graded based on two criteria:

* Correctness: Does your program work according to the specification?
* Coding Quality and Style: Is your code well written and understandable?

We provide a detailed code quality and style guide [here](https://erasmusuniversityautolab.github.io/FEB22012-StyleGuide/), but the final verdict of coding quality and style comes from human graders.

You need to hand in assignments **individually**, and you need to write the code you hand in **by yourself**. This means that you cannot copy code from the internet (including Stack Exchange). You need to explain how your code works, by use of comments.

### Use of Generative AI, such as ChatGPT

**It is not allowed to use Generative AI, such as ChatGPT, to write or rewrite your code**.
You should write all code you submit yourself.
It is allowed to ask AI-tools to explain the materials, error messages you encounter or concepts you struggle to understand from the learning materials.
You can use them to suggest debugging strategies for particular errors. You remain responsible for the correctness of the AI, and you must be aware that
AI can hallucinate non-existing functions or make mistakes.
Doing the coding and debugging yourself, allows you to learn from your mistakes, which is a necessary skill to develop when the AI makes mistakes or fails.


## Plagiarism
We use **plagiarism scanning tools**. If we find any cases of suspected plagiarism, we are required to report these cases to the exam committee.
The analysis of suspected plagiarism can take a couple of months, due to other teaching obligations. Since last year, students who were caught **failed the course** and got FR on their grade list.

Here are some examples on what you can and cannot do:

* You **can** discuss the logic necessary to solve the exercises (high level approach) with your fellow students.
* You **can** use and discuss useful documentation from the book, official software documentation and lecture notes that can help solve the exercises.
* You **cannot** discuss line by line implementations with a fellow student.
* You **cannot** discuss what functions to write to solve an exercises (progam structure).
* You **cannot** discuss the order in which loops and other control structures occur to solve the exercises.
* You **cannot** discuss what comments to write.

When another students ask you if they can have your code: **refuse!**
If someone looks at your screen to copy your code: First comment on it, and ask them not to do so. If this doesn’t help, alert the tutor. If that doesn’t help too, go sit somewhere else.
Beware: if we find your code matches code of another student, **both students** will be suspected of fraud and have to explain themselves to the exam committee.

### Struggling with assignments

Since you are expected to work on the assignments for a significant amount of time,
they make up a significant part of your grade. If for some reason you struggle with the assignments, please discuss your issues
either with your tutorial teacher if you attend tutorials, or contact us via the course e-mail of your respective course.
We will always try our best to help students and are open to answer questions.
Furthermore, if you struggle with your studies in general, it is always important to discuss your situation
with [the study advisors](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/education/practical-matters/study-advisers)
so the school is aware of your personal situation.

Some students may be **tempted to try and cut corners, in particular related to assignments**.
**Doing so hurts you ability to learn from them, making it much harder for you to prepare for the exams** by practice.
As Codegrade typically gives you a good indication of what your grade will approximately be, it may feel tempting
to always aim for a 10. However, it may be wise to aim below a ten and still take time to learn from the assignments,
than cut corners and skip out on the learning opportunity provided by the assignments. Every year, there are numerous
students with good grades for the assignments who ultimately fail to write sensible code, debug mistakes or explain
the more abstract theoretical concepts on the exam.

## Codegrade

Assignments are handed in via CodeGrade, which can be accessed by clicking on the assignment in Canvas.
Codegrade has a feature “Continuous Feedback”. When you **hand in your code early**, you get feedback telling you which parts of you code do not work yet. Parts of the assignment that do not pass the continuous feedback will not receive any points during your final grade.
The final grade is still checked by humans: if they find mistakes that were unfortunately not found by Codegrade, you can still lose points.


## Exam

For FEB22012 and FEB22012X there is an exam which counts for 40%. In order to obtain a valid grade for this course, you need to obtain at least a 3 for the exam. Furthemore, in order to obtain a valid grade for this course you need to obtain at least a 3 on average for the assignments.

The exam is a "paper" exam, where you do not have access to the compiler or a programming environment such as IntelliJ or Eclipse. By working extensively on the assignments, it is expected that you are able to write typical small pieces of programs
in accordance with all the theory and rules that are learned during the course. Roughly 50% of the exam consists of theory questions, and 50% asks you to write code this way.

There is currently a lot of uncertainty surrounding the time, place and way the exam is done. If more information becomes available, this will be communicated via Canvas announcements.
