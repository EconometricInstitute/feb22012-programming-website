The final grade for the course is composed of the grades obtained for assignments (30%) and for the grade of the exam (70%). Note that the exam can be retaken at the end of the academic year (under the conditions set by the university), but that the assignments can only be retaken in the next academic year.

## Assignments  
Three graded assignments sets will be published via Canvas, which have a deadline in week 3, 5 and 7 of the course, respectively. Note that these assignments are different ones than the practice assignments that can be found on this site, where the assignments on this site are there strictly for practicing. The graded assignments have to be completed individually and feedback can be obtained on them, also before the deadline, by means of an online grading system.

## Exam
The exam takes place *online*, on Wednesday October 21, due to the COVID-19 measures taken by the university. This means that the exam is made within a proctored environment and takes 2 hours (instead of 3 hours as for a physical exam). The exam will be a closed book exam. Further details on how the exam will look like and how the online proctoring system works will follow in due time via Canvas.
