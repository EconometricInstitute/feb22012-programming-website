The final grade for the course is composed of the grades obtained for assignments (60%) and for the grade of the exam (40%). Note that the exam can be retaken at the end of the academic year (under the conditions set by the university), but that the assignments can only be retaken in the next academic year.

## Assignments  
Three graded assignments sets will be published via Canvas, which have a deadline in week 2, 4 and 6 of the course, respectively. Each assignment counts for 20% in the final grade. Note that these assignments are different ones than the practice assignments that can be found on this website, where the assignments on this site are there strictly for practicing. The graded assignments have to be completed individually and feedback can be obtained on them, also before the deadline, by means of an online grading system.

Assignments are graded based on two criteria:
- Correctness: Does your program work according to the specification?
- Coding Quality and Style: Is your code well written and understandable?
We provide a detailed code quality and style guide [here](https://erasmusuniversityautolab.github.io/FEB22012-StyleGuide/), but the final verdict of coding quality and style comes from human graders.
 
You need to hand in assignments **individually**, and you need to write the code you hand in **by yourself**. This means that you cannot copy code from the internet (including Stack Exchange). You need to explain how your code works, by use of comments.

### Plagiarism
We use **plagiarism scanning tools**. If we find any cases of suspected plagiarism, we are required to report these cases to the exam committee.
The analysis of suspected plagiarism can take a couple of months, due to other teaching obligations. Since last year, students who were caught **failed the course** and got FR on their grade list.

Here are some examples on what you can and cannot do:
- You **can** discuss the logic necessary to solve the exercises (high level approach) with your fellow students.
- You **can** use and discuss useful documentation from the book, official software documentation and lecture notes that can help solve the exercises.
- You **cannot** discuss line by line implementations with a fellow student.
- You **cannot** discuss what functions to write to solve an exercises (progam structure).
- You **cannot** discuss the order in which loops and other control structures occur to solve the exercises.
- You **cannot** discuss what comments to write.

When another students ask you if they can have your code: **refuse!** 
If someone looks at your screen to copy your code: First comment on it, and ask them not to do so. If this doesn‚Äôt help, alert the tutor. If that doesn‚Äôt help too, go sit somewhere else.
Beware: if we find your code matches code of another student, **both students** will be suspected of fraud and have to explain themselves to the exam committee.

### Codegrade
Assignments are handed in via CodeGrade, which can be accessed by clicking on the assignment in Canvas.
Codegrade now has a feature ‚ÄúContinuous Feedback‚Äù. When you **hand in your code early**, you get feedback telling you which parts of you code do not work yet. Parts of the assignment that do not pass the continuous feedback will not receive any points during your final grade.
The final grade is still checked by humans: if they find mistakes that were unfortunately not found by Codegrade, you can still lose points.

## How to study
Lectures emphasize important theory. Before or afterwards you can read about this material on the website. 
During tutorials you can get help and ask questions about the assignments while working on them.
Also, make use of continuous feedback, so start working on assignments early. This allows you to ask specific questions during tutorials.
When working on assignments, make sure you understand how the discussed theory is brought to practice. This is important for the exam

## Exam
As it seems now, the exam will take place *on campus*, on Tuesday October 19th at 9:30 üï§. The exam takes 3 hours on (ANS) paper, and will be a closed book exam. Half the questions are theory, half of them are writing code by hand. You get a reference of methods and classes. The exam focuses on understanding of the Java language and problem solving skills. The assignments focus on implementation.
Further details on how the exam will look like will follow in due time via Canvas.
Both your total grade for the exam **and** for the combined assignments must be at least a 3.
