- Give an example of the exercise and solution components

</text-box>

Below is an example of the simple exercise environment I added

<Exercise title="An example exercise">

Here you can write some exercise text.

If you make sure there is an empty line after the `Exercise` and `Solution` tags,
it seems the content of this environment also gets process by the markdown renderer!

* This list seems to be working?
* That is nice....

### The actual question

What do you get if evaluate the expression 1+1?

<Solution>

The answer is two!

That *is* a nice answer!

In a code block it looks as follows:

```
1 + 1 = 2
```

</Solution>

</Exercise>

That was the Exercise envirnoment! Hopefully it can be useful!
