## Computer Programs
When programming, we write `source code` in order to tell the computer what to execute.
This source code is then translated to more elementary instructions, such as addition and multiplication, that are executed by the processor of your computer.
In essence, your source code describes the steps that a computer should take to go from input to output.
Together, these steps are often referred to as a `computer program`, or `program` for short.

Source code is written in a `programming language`, where the programming language defines commands and methods that can be used to write your code.
This allows you to use more high-level functions and methods, instead of having to use only the very elementary computations that your processor provides.
In this course we will consider the `Java` programming language, which is among the most often used programming languages out there.

## Characteristics of Java
Java is a member of the class of object-oriented programming languages, where objects offer a convenient abstraction to think about the code that you write.
We will have a further look at objects in week 5 of this course.
Other popular programming languages using objects include `C++`, `C#` and `Python`.
All of these, including Java, rank within the [top 10 of most popular programming languages](https://octoverse.github.com/#top-languages).
Learning Java will thus provide you with a good basis for learning many other popular (object-oriented) programming languages.

Another important reason for the popularity of Java is that a Java program can be run on any platform. This means that you can easily share your written program with someone else and that this person can directly run your code without having to make changes or to transform the code to a different format. This is made possible by the `Java Compiler`, which translates the source code that the computer needs to run to code (`bytecode`). This bytecode is then compiled into code your computer can understand, `CPU-specific Assembly`, by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine); that way the CPU on that computer can execute it.

## This course
In this course, you will become familiar with some of the most important concepts of Java.
In essence, our aim is that you will be able to write simple Java programs after this course that you can use during your studies.
Moreover, this will provide you with a first stepping stone to learn more advanced programming concepts, either in follow-up courses or by self-study.
