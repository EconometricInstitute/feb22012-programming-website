- You know what is meant with the concept of a generic type parameter.

- You are familiar with already existing Java classes that make use of generic type parameters.

- You can create classes of your own that make use of generic type parameters.

## Introduction to types
Since we began using lists, we have given data structures the type of the values that we want them to store. For example, a list that stores strings has been defined as `ArrayList<String>`. But why would we bother about types?

First consider the following code:
```java
int student = 36;
int grade = 45;
register(student, grade);
```
Is this correct code? It depends on how the register method is defined. Consider the two following options:
```java
public static void register(int grade, int student) {...}
``` 
or
```java
public static void register(int student, int grade) {...}
```
**The best way to avoid bugs is to make them impossible.**
If we would rewrite this code using types, only one register method signature is valid, such that the compiler will tell if we present the right parameters.
```java
Student student = getStudent(36);
Grade grade = getGrade(12);
register(student, grade);
```
In the above code, we have used the Student and Grade types. Now, `public static void register(Grade grade, Student student)` will not compile, but `public static void register(Student student, Grade grade)` will. This way, a mistake is already found by the compiler before we can even run the code.

The use of types in Java both has advantages and disadvantages, which are listed below.
Advantages
* A powerful type system helps to **prevent bugs**.
* Your programming environment uses types to tell you what you can do with the object.
* Code becomes **easier to read** when your variables have types.
* Types make it easier to write **modular code** since it allows for polymorphism which we discuss later in this course.
* Automated manipulation of your code by means of **refactoring** becomes safer.

Disadvantages
* As types need to be declared, you need **more code** to do the same thing.
* A decent understanding of the **type system** of the language is required.

## Primitive types
In Java, eight primitive types exist, which you already know: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char` and `boolean`. Primitive types are not considered as objects and they just represent raw values. All other types are non-primitive, such as `String`, `List` and arrays.

Sometimes, it is useful to convert types. In some cases, this can be done automatically, for example:
```java
int number = 233;
double sameNumber = number; //sameNumber holds 233.0 now
```
This type of conversion is called **implicit casting**, because casting is done automatically without us telling explicitly that the compiler should cast the number to the other type.
In other cases, however, this is not possible, such as in this case:
```java
double number = 123.0;
int sameNumber = number; //this will give an error
```
In general, **automatic conversion is only possible if the conversion goes from a more specific to a more general type**. This way, the compiler saves you from _loss of precision_ without realizing.
In some cases we may still want to convert a `double` into an `int` value because we know that it will work out right. 
We can do that by **explicit casting**, which is basically telling the compiler to override the type system, like this:
```java
double number 123.0;
int sameNumber = (int) number; //sameNumber holds 123 now
```

## Non-Primitive Types
All types that are not primitive types are non-primitive types. Examples of these are `String`, `Scanner`, `int[]`, and the classes you create yourself result in new non-primitive types such as `Student` and `Course`.
Since Java 5 we can also construct type-of-type things like `ArrayList<String>`.
Lastly, for every primitive type there is an associated non-primitive type, spelled with an uppercase letter: `Byte`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`, `Character`, `Boolean`. For these special types, primitive types and their corresponding non-primitive types can be mixed. This is called **autoboxing** and conversion is carried out automatically mostly.
For instance, conversion from `Integer` to `double` is done automatically, but from `int` to Double is not possible.

## Generic types
Until now, we have seen classes and methods for which the types used were explicitly determined in the class or method signature. But can you implement a class that can contain objects of any given type?
_Generics_ relates to how classes that store objects can store objects of a freely chosen type. 
The choice is based on the generic type parameter in the definition of the classes, which makes it possible to choose the type(s) *at the moment of the object's creation*. 
Using generics is done in the following manner: after the name of the class, follow it with a chosen number of type parameters. Each of them is  placed between the 'smaller than' and 'greater than' signs, like this: `public class Class<TypeParameter1, TypeParameter2, ...>`. The type parameters are usually defined with a single character.

Let's implement our own generic class `Locker` that can hold one object of any type.

```java
public class Locker<T> {
    private T element;

    public void setValue(T element) {
        this.element = element;
    }

    public T getValue() {
        return element;
    }
}
```

The definition `public class Locker<T>` indicates that the `Locker` class must be given a type parameter in its constructor. After the constructor call is executed, all the variables stored in that object are going to be of the type that was given with the constructor. Let's create a locker for storing strings.

```java
Locker<String> string = new Locker<>();
string.setValue(":)");

System.out.println(string.getValue());
```

<sample-output>

:)

</sample-output>


In the program above, the **runtime** implementation of the `Locker` object named `string` looks like the following.

```java
public class Locker<String> {
    private String element;

    public void setValue(String element) {
        this.element = element;
    }

    public String getValue() {
        return element;
    }
}
```

Changing the type parameter allows for creating lockers that store objects of other types. You could store an integer in the following manner.

```java
Locker<Integer> integer = new Locker<>();
integer.setValue(5);

System.out.println(integer.getValue());
```

<sample-output>

5

</sample-output>

There is no maximum on the number of type parameters, it's all dependent on the implementation. The programmer could implement the following `Pair` class that is able to store two objects of specified types.

```java
public class Pair<T, K> {
    private T first;
    private K second;

    public void setValues(T first, K second) {
        this.first = first;
        this.second = second;
    }

    public T getFirst() {
        return this.first;
    }

    public K getSecond() {
        return this.second;
    }
}
```

A significant portion of the Java data structures use type parameters, which enables them to handle different types of variables. ArrayList, for instance, receives a single type parameter, while the HashMap (which we will cover later in this course) receives two.

```java
List<String> strings = new ArrayList<>();
Map<String, String> keyValuePairs = new HashMap<>();
```
