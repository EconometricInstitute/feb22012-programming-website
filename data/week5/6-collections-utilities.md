- You are aware of the utility methods in the `Collections` class that can help you deal with `Collection` objects

</text-box>

Before starting this last paragraph, let us first test our knowledge of what we have learned so far.

<Exercise title="Test your knowledge">

In this quiz, you can test your knowledge on the subjects covered in this chapter.

What is the difference between a `List` and a `Set` object?

<Solution>

In a `List`, we store items in an order, and preserve the order. We can iterate through the list by index. In a `Set`, however, we also store items, but without keeping track of any order. 
Another difference is that an item might occur twice in a `List`, but in a `Set` each item can occur at most once.
  
</Solution>

What is a `Map`?
  
<Solution>

A `Map` is a `Collection` interface that provides data structures to store pairs of things. Each pair has a **key** and a **value**. For each key, a certain value is stored. This means that each key may occur only once, as otherwise it would not be clear which key the program should return the value of.
The values, on the other hand, may occur multiple times, as different keys can hold the same value.
The most commonly used `Map` is the `HashMap`.

</Solution>

### Collections class

Java contains a number of classes that provide handy, `static` utility methods. Example of this you may have see before are
`Math`, using `Math.pow()` or `Math.sin()`, or `Arrays`, using `Arrays.toString()` to convert an array to a string you can
print conveniently.

There is a similar class with useful utility methods that can be used to deal with all kinds of `Collection` objects.

Some useful methods for List types:

```java
public static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> void sort(List<T> list)
public static <T> void sort(List<T> list, Comparator<? super T> c)
public static void reverse(List<?> list)
public static void shuffle(List<?> list, Random rnd)
```

The `sort` method has been discussed last week, and can be used to sort a `List`,
either by relying on the natural order of an object, or specifying a custom order
by providing a `Comparator` as a second argument. We can also reverse the order of
the list, or randomize the order of the elements by using a `Random` object with
the `shuffle` method, which randomizes the order like you would shuffle a deck of
cards.

The are also a number of useful methods for very basic statistics:

```java
public static <T> T max(Collection<? extends T> coll, Comparator<? super T> comp)
public static <T> T min(Collection<? extends T> coll, Comparator<? super T> comp)
public static int frequency(Collection<?> c, Object o)
```

We can find the minimum or maximum value in any `Collection` (so this works for
both `Set` and `List` objects) according to an order specified by a given `Comparator`
with the `min` and `max` methods. The `frequency` method can be used to determine
how often a certain element appeart in a `Collection`, which will work on a `Set`
and a `List`, even though a typical `Set` will contain an element at most once.

If we want to return a version of a `List`, `Set` or `Map` that cannot be modified (and we donâ€™t want to copy it),
there are helper methods that wrap the `List`, `Set` or `Map` in a so-called *proxy* that will
throw an `Exception` as soon as you call any mutator method on it, but which can still be used
to read the data from the data structure.

```java
public static <T> Set<T> unmodifiableSet(Set<? extends T> s)
public static <T> List<T> unmodifiableList(List<? extends T> list)
public static <K,V> Map<K,V> unmodifiableMap(Map<? extends K, ? extends V> m)
```

With these methods, we have a very powerful and flexible toolkit to handle large collections
of objects.
