Support for this course will mainly be provided through scheduled sessions. 
For an overview of when the sessions take place, see the online timetable: [EN](https://timetables.eur.nl/link?timetables.0.key=FEB22012X&timetables.0.type=module&timetables.0.source=2021&timetables.1.key=FEB22012X&timetables.1.type=examrequirement&ignoreEmpty=true&ignoreNotFound=true&view=list&term=2021:Academic%20Year).
Moreover, additional help can be obtained by posting questions on the course `Canvas Discussion Board` page.

### Lecture videos
There will not be a regular lecture for this course. Instead, every week has a series of videos that become available on Monday through Canvas. Most videos are around 10-20 minutes in length, and each video discusses a topic from that week. You are recommended to watch the videos on Monday, as they are intended to get you started with the material of the week, and provide some further depth. After watching the videos, you should be well prepared to go through the material and practice exercises of the week.

### Question Hours
As asking questions is not possible during the lecture, there is a weekly question hour on to ask questions about the material. In the first week, there will be an additional question hour where you can ask questions about the setup of the course. The question hours last 45 minutes and take place via `Microsoft Teams`. You will automatically be added to the Teams page of this course, from where the question hour will be started. For installing and logging in to Teams, see the [manuals provided by the University](https://my.eur.nl/en/eur/ict-1/teams-chat-and-presence). 

### Tutorials
In the bachelor's second year, tutorials are no longer mandatory. If you want to attend tutorials, you should sign up before August 30th! You can do this in Sin Online by choosing `My registrations`. You should pick a group, check the box and save changes. Note that you can **only** participate in the group that you have subscribed to!

Each week there is a tutorial, where there will be a TA present to help you with questions regarding the practice exercises, homework assignments, or any general questions about the material. 
The idea is that you will work on the hand-in exercises during the tutorial. However, it is expected that you have already worked on the exercises and prepared some questions. As far as is known at this moment, tutorials will take place on campus. Further information on how the tutorials take place will be provided by your TA during the first tutorial session.

### Discussion Board
If additional question pop up, that you were not be able to ask during the question hour or tutorial sessions, you can ask them on the `Canvas Discussion Board` of the course. We will try to regularly check the discussion board and answer any questions that pop-up. Note that if you ask a question here, all students in the course can see it and benefit from the answer. However, this also means that you have to make sure not to include any personal information or any part of a solution for an assignment in these questions.

### Email
For any personal matters you could [send me an email](mailto:bouman@ese.eur.nl). However, the number of participants of the course is large, I would kindly ask you not to email about questions regarding the assignments or content of the course. If it turns out that there are too many questions to answer during the question hour, then I will organize additional question hours.
