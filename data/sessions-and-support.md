### Communcation and Netiquette

Since some things are still uncertain and part of the activities take place online, it is important that we agree on a set of rules that make the education go as smooth and pleasant as possible. Within this course we have the following rules:

* Keep track of the announcements on Canvas. If important things change within how the course is run, this will always be communicated via the announcements.
* Always send e-mails to this course using your student e-mail and sent them to the course e-mail. We are not obliged to answer e-mails that do not follow this rule.
* Personal questions, including those related to your work on the assignments, should be asked in person during on-campus sessions or via e-mail to the e-mail box of your course. **Never** ask personal questions within public channels, such as the discussion board or the Microsoft Teams channels of the course, as others will be able to read this and may plagiarize your code.
* Be active during the tutorial: add remarks, ask questions, participate in group discussions.

### How to study
Lecture videos emphasize important theory. Before or afterwards you can read about this material on the website.
In FEB22012 and FEB22012X you can use tutorials to get help and ask questions about the assignments while working on them.
In FEB61003 there are question hours available for support.
Also, in order to be succesful in the assignments, it is vital to use the automated feedback provided by Codegrade. It is therefore important to start working on assignments early, so you have enough time to process the feedback. This also allows you to ask specific questions during tutorials. Assignments that are not able to pass the automated feedback do not get points.
When working on assignments, make sure you understand how the discussed theory is brought to practice. This is important for the exam. There are some self checks on the different pages of this website that can also be used to prepare for the exam. There are also practice exams available.
