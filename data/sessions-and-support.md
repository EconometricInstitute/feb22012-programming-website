Moreover, additional help can be obtained by posting questions on the course `Canvas Discussion Board` page.

### Lectures and Demonstration and Question Sessions

This course is organized with a flipping the classroom setup. Every week has a series of videos that become available on Monday through Canvas, please watch them on Panopto. They are intended to get you started with the material of the week. After watching the videos, you should be well prepared to go through the material and exercises of the week. The lectures in the schedule are interactive demonstration and Demonstration & Question sessions, where attendance is not mandatory. You can ask questions about lecture videos of that and the previous week during the Demonstration & Question sessions.

Until further notice the Demonstration & Question session will take place on Microsoft Teams. Read the general instructions on Microsoft Teams in this document if you want to participate. The link needed to join will be posted on Canvas.

Within the Microsoft Teams meeting you can raise your hand. If you do this, you will get a turn to ask your question. Since the goal of the Demonstration and Question sessions is to address general questions, the questions will be asked and answered plenary. Questions about your work on assignments can be asked during the tutorials.

### Tutorials

Each week there is a tutorial, where there will be a TA present to help you with questions regarding the practice exercises, homework assignments, or any general questions about the material.
The idea is that you will work on the hand-in exercises during the tutorial. However, it is expected that you have already worked on the exercises and prepared some questions. As far as is known at this moment, tutorials will take place on campus. Further information on how the tutorials take place will be provided by your TA during the first tutorial session.

The tutorials take place on campus, except for a handful of students who have received permission to follow tutorials online. In case you can not attend a tutorial due to a COVID-19 infection, please send us an e-mail on [eb-feb22012@ese.eur.nl](mailto:eb-feb22012@ese.eur.nl) and we will arrange a suitable alternative.

In the bachelor's second year, tutorials are no longer mandatory and attendance is not an issue. However, we strongly suggest you attend because it is a good opportunity to discuss the theory and assignment related struggles with the teaching staff and your fellow students.

### Discussion Board
If additional questions pop up, that you were not be able to ask during the Demonstration and Question sessions or tutorial sessions, you can ask them on the `Canvas Discussion Board` of the course. We will try to regularly check the discussion board and answer any questions that pop-up. Note that if you ask a question here, all students in the course can see it and benefit from the answer. However, this also means that you have to make sure not to include any personal information or any part of a solution for an assignment in these questions.

As you are not allowed to share the code for your assignment with other students, please do not ask personal questions/questions about your assignment work. Also, do not contact the course coordinator or your TAâ€™s using MS Teams outside the official contact hours. If you violate this rule, we reserve the right to block all MS Teams communication with you.

### Email
For any personal matters and urgent questions about your assignment you can send an e-mail to [eb-feb22012@ese.eur.nl](mailto:eb-feb22012@ese.eur.nl). However, the number of participants of the course is large, we kindly ask you to ask about questions regarding the assignments or content of the course. If it turns out that there are too many questions to answer during the Demonstration & Question session then we either extend it or arrange alternatives.

You can contact the course coordinator via the e-mail adress [eb-feb22012@ese.eur.nl](mailto:eb-feb22012@ese.eur.nl). **Always use the course e-mail to contact us.** It is very much possible that e-mail sent to personal mailboxes will be answered extremely late, or not answered at all.

It is *mandatory* to send all e-mail from your official student e-mail, provided to you by the EUR.

### Communcation and Netiquette

Since some things are still uncertain and part of the activities take place online, it is important that we agree on a set of rules that make the education go as smooth and pleasant as possible. Within this course we have the following rules:

* Keep track of the announcements on Canvas. If important things change within how the course is run, this will always be communicated via the announcements.
* Always send e-mails to this course using your student e-mail and sent them to the course e-mail. We are not obliged to answer e-mails that do not follow this rule.
* Personal questions, including those related to your work on the assignments, should be asked only in one-on-one calls with a TA or via e-mail to [eb-feb22012@ese.eur.nl](mailto:eb-feb22012@ese.eur.nl). **Never** ask personal questions within public channels, such as the discussion board or the Microsoft Teams channels of the course, as others will be able to read this.
* It is **not allowed to call or chat with teachers of this course outside the scheduled contact moments** if you were not given explicit permission to do so. If you break this rule, the teacher has the right to put you on their Microsoft Teams block list. The repercussions of that are your own responsibility. If you feel the need to ask questions about the course outside the scheduled hours, you should do so via the course e-mail address [eb-feb22012@ese.eur.nl](mailto:eb-feb22012@ese.eur.nl).
* Be active during the tutorial: add remarks, ask questions, participate in group discussions.

For the attendance of digital events, the following rules apply:

* Be on time.
* Turn on your camera and use your (full) name to break anonymity.
* Avoid distractions and turn off notifications on your phone and computer.
* Mute your microphone during plenary parts, unmute if you want to say or ask something.
* Behave online as you would do offline.


### How to study
Lectures emphasize important theory. Before or afterwards you can read about this material on the website.
During tutorials you can get help and ask questions about the assignments while working on them.
Also, make use of continuous feedback, so start working on assignments early. This allows you to ask specific questions during tutorials.
When working on assignments, make sure you understand how the discussed theory is brought to practice. This is important for the exam

### Microsoft Teams

The contact moments that would normally take place in class rooms will be held in Microsoft Teams. Make sure you have installed the Microsoft Teams application on your computer and that you are logged in with your EUR student account. You can download Microsoft Teams [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app).

We will provide links on Canvas to the Demonstration and Question sessions. The students who are allowed to follow an online tutorial will be invited to join a team with a channel for the tutorials.
