### How to study

1. **Watch the lecture videos and/or read written materials on the course website first thing in the week (Mon/Tue).**
   - The [course website](https://feb22012.ese.eur.nl) and videos on Canvas both contain the same learning content.
   - After each topic, you can take the “Test your Knowledge” quiz on the course website.

2. **Assignments**
   - Start early – you’ll need time for Codegrade feedback and debugging.
   - If an part of the assignment fails automated tests, it earns no points.
   - Use Codegrade’s continuous feedback; it trains you to write code better and fix bugs that will be useful later.

3. **Tutorials & Help**
   - In the non‑SPOC versions, tutorials are the place to ask for help while working on assignments.
   - If you’re stuck on an assignment for more than a day, or are affected by a hard-to-spot bug in your code, email us at `eb-feb22012@ese.eur.nl`.

4. **Exam preparation**
   - Review all theory from the course materials; it will be tested in the exam.
   - Review how this theory was applied within the assignments to check you understand.
   - Use the practice exams and learning‑question pages on the website (answers are optional).

5. **Breaks & Time‑management**
   - Take breaks when you hit a frustrating bug, often it is much easier to find after a rest.
   - Avoid cramming – spread work over several days so you.
