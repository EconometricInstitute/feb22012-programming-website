Support for this course will mainly be provided by means of the scheduled sessions. For an overview of when the sessions take place, see the [online timetable](https://timetables.eur.nl/link?timetables.0.key=FEB21011S&timetables.0.type=module&timetables.0.source=2020&timetables.1.key=FEB21011S&timetables.1.type=examrequirement&ignoreEmpty=true&ignoreNotFound=true&view=list&term=2020:Academic%20Year). Moreover, additional help can be obtained by posting questions on the course `Canvas Discussion Board` page.

### Lectures
There will be one lecture per week, which is presented in an online format due to the Coronavirus measures. This lecture will be pre-recorded, meaning that you can decide to watch it whenever you like. The lectures will take 1-1.5 hour each and will become available on Monday morning through Canvas. The lectures are meant to give an overview of the material of that week and will go into further depth on some of the discussed topics.

### Question hours
As asking questions is not possible during the lecture, there is a weekly question hour to ask questions about the lecture. This question hour lasts 45 minutes and takes place via `Microsoft Teams`. You will automatically be added to the Teams page of this course, from where the question hour will be started. For installing and logging in to Teams, see the [manuals provided by the University](https://my.eur.nl/en/eur/ict-1/teams-chat-and-presence).

### Tutorials
A weekly tutorial takes place to help you with completing the assignments of the course. Every student is assigned to a tutorial group and each tutorial group has a scheduled moment during the week during which the tutorial takes place. The tutorials will also take place through `Microsoft Teams`, where you will be automatically added to the Teams channel that corresponds to your tutorial group. Further information on how the tutorials take place will be provided by your TA during the first tutorial session.

### Question page
When additional questions pop up, which cannot easily be answered during the question hour or during the tutorial sessions, these can be asked on the `Canvas Discussion board` page of the course. Make sure to not include any personal information or any part of a solution for an assignment in these questions, as they can be viewed by all students in the course.
